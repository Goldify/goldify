## Fork & Run Goldify

### Spotify API Configuration

Before building with Docker, you will need to create your own Spotify Developer App, if you haven't already done so. This can be done [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/](here).

Once you have completed this, you will need to create an `.env` file in the root directory of your forked repo. The contents should be as follows:

```
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID>"
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET>"
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI = "<YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_REDIRECT_URI>"
```

### Running Goldify with Docker

To build with Docker, the following commands can be run:

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

If you prefer to run without Docker, you can also run the following:

```
yarn install
yarn run start
```

## Testing/Linting

All changes made to this repo should pass testing and linting standards, and will be checked by GitHub Actions.

To test and lint your changes locally, the following commands can be used:

```
docker-compose exec goldify yarn test

If you are running Goldify without Docker, you can run the following:
